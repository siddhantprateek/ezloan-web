## What are the benefits of availing of a Personal Loan?

Unlike other types of loans like Home Loan or Gold Loan, where you must provide several documents, Personal Loans require minimum documents and the approval process is quick.
With various financial institutions offering Personal Loan online services, the loan amount is disbursement within a few hours provided the lender is convinced of your repayment capacity.
Another significant feature of Personal Loan is that the lenders offer you the flexibility to choose your loan tenure. Usually, Personal Loan tenure ranges from one to five years. So, you can select the loan term based on your repayment capacity. You should opt for a shorter loan, so that you can save on the interest payment and repay the amount faster.
